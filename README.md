Through DefenseDroid, we tend to gift a machine learning-based system for the detection of malware on android devices. DefenseDroid will effectively identify, detect, categorize apps and safeguard android mobile devices from malicious apps thus avoiding any stealing or misuse of the userâ€™s data by using an easy user interface. In our project, a code behavior signature-based malware detection framework mistreatment associate degree LSTM rule is planned, which might sight malicious code and their variants effectively in runtime and extend malware characteristics information dynamically.
